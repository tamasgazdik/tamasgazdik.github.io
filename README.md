## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Cascading Style Sheets 3
- Flexbox


### What I learned

To create a somewhat responsive design, I used media-query. That was the first time I used one since I started learning front-end development, and I'm so glad it does what I needed from it.

```css
@media (max-width: 900px) {
    .container {
        width: 80%;
    }

    h1 {
        font-size: 1.25rem;
    }

    p {
        font-size: 1rem;
    }
}
```

I also learned to use relative units such as `rem` for font sizing, instead of hardcoding pixels for them.


### Continued development

The design is not as responsive as I'd like it to be, there are some width-height ratios where the site just doesn't look the way I want it, so I'll definitely look into responsive design more.


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools CSS Media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp) - Great starting content with media queries.

## Acknowledgments

I really liked this challenge, and I would like to thank for this pleasant experience to frontendmentor.io for providing all necessary information, some great tips, design concepts and the assets required for the project up front, so I didn't have to figure out stuff on my own, but instead could focus on the building part.
